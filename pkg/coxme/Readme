  The majority of the code found in the R directory has been authored using
the noweb package.  These are all the files generated by the Makefile
there, and which have the first line line 
    `automatically generated form all.nw using noweb'

If making changes, use the real source and not these files!

Unfortunately, the standard R setup does not include noweb.  Thus there
is a difference between the source code on Rforge and the code found on
CRAN.
   Rforge: `Derived files should not be kept under version control.'  Thus
coxme.R etc are not present.  The files configure and cleanup in this
directory control automatic builds of them.  If you are
going to play with the code, install a copy of noweb and all will be well.

   CRAN: I can't count on noweb being present -- in fact it almost surely 
isn't.  A separate copy of the code is made, the configure script is run to
generate the .R files, and then configure and cleanup are deleted.  The
result is submitted to CRAN.

  See further notes in the ../inst/noweb directory.
