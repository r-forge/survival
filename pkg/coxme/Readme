  The majority of the code found in the R directory has been authored using
the noweb package.  These are all the files with a first line
    `automatically generated from all.nw using noweb'

If making changes, use the real source and not these files!  It is found
in inst/noweb, and the R files are created by 'make fun'.

Unfortunately, the standard R setup does not include noweb.  Thus there
is a difference between the source code on Rforge and the code found on
CRAN.
   Rforge: `Derived files should not be kept under version control.'  Thus
R/coxme.R etc are not present.  The files configure and cleanup in this
directory control automatic builds of them.  If you are going to work
on the code, install a copy of noweb and all will be well.  The standard
R CMD utilities all work.

   CRAN: I can't count on noweb being present -- in fact it almost surely 
isn't.  A separate copy of the code is made, the configure script is run to
generate the .R files, and then configure and cleanup are deleted from that
copy.  The result is submitted to CRAN.

  See further notes in the ../inst/noweb directory.
