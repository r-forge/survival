 Major portions of the coxme package have been written using the literate
programming paradym.  These are contained here, and have a .Rnw suffix.
Long term, the plan is to have all of the code source here to maximize
the documentation, and through it the reliability of the package.

These files are NOT intended for processing by Sweave.  The function of Sweave
is to execute R fragments, interspersing code and results.  The purpose of
this material is to create the .R source code and a detailed latex commentary
on that code.  In particular, Sweave cannot reassemble a named chunk of
code from scattered fragments.  The latter is one of the main advantages
of the noweb system: you can organise the presentation for optimal explanation
rather than in exectuion order.

The .Rnw suffix causes emacs work perfectly for either a noweb or Sweave 
target, however, which is very nice.

We also include a file noweb.R, derived from noweb.Rnw of course, which is
an R implementation of the notangle function.  This allows the code to
be self contained.  There are plans to merge this functionality into
Rtangle one day so the file will hopefully become obsolete.  I have not
as yet implemented the noweave function; the Makefile target
all.pdf is the only one that requires it.

The result file all.pdf is documentation for understanding the code, 
not how to use the coxme function for data analysis.  For those who
maintain the code it should be a big help, for everyone else I'd bet on
"deathly boring".  

The noweb.R and all.pdf files are logged in svn, in spite of the general rule
against maintaining both a source (e.g., noweb.Rnw) and a result (e.g.,noweb.R),
since not many users will have the noweb software installed.
