  Change the default starting value of variances from .2 to .1. A std of
sqrt(.2)= .45 is actually quite big (50% variance in risk due to the 
random effect); sqrt(.1) = .31 seems more reasonable.  Motivated by a data
set where .2 led to the wrong solution. This area needs more investigation.
A std of .2 seems better yet, but on the log(var) scale a plot of the loglik
often has a convex "dish" near zero, leading to lots of iterations for optim.
  Fix error in the fitting routine; if there were 3 or more crossed terms
the indexing was wrong, leading to no penalty for terms after the second.
  Allow for NULL as an initial value.  This occured for a model with 3 terms
(x1|grp) + (x2|grp) + (x3|grp), and I wanted to give values for x2 and x3
only.  You can't use names since they all are the same, instead I now use
vfixed=list(NULL, .1, .1).

  Fix to coxmeMlist to match the above - missed changing one of the .2s to
a .1.  Update the slope1.Rout.save file; the prior change modified
some of the final printed results' tail end digits.

  Finish debugging the noweb.R code, which duplicates (part of) the
functionality of the Unix noweb software.  This allows my Makefile to work
automatically when that software is not present.
