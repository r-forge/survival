 Some portions of the coxme package have been written using the literate
programming paradym.  These are contained here, and have a .Rnw suffix.
Long term, the plan is to have all of the code source here to maximize
the documentation, and through it the reliability of the package.

These files are NOT intended for processing by Sweave.  The function of Sweave
is to execute R fragments, interspersing code and results.  The purpose of
this material is to create the .R source code and a detailed latex commentary
on that code.  In particular, Sweave does not echo code verbatim, it echos
the R parser's rewrite of the code.  This is necessary to correctly interleave
output but is counterproductive to our purposes since it removes useful
formatting.

The result file all.pdf is documentation for understanding the code, 
not how to use the coxme function for data analysis.  For those who
maintain the code it should be a big help, for everyone else I'd bet on
"deathly boring".  

It would be nice if Rtangle could be used to extract the code since that would
make the library self contained for compilation purposes.  But, Rtangle
does not know how to pull out named code chunks.

The .Rnw suffix causes emacs work perfectly for either a noweb or Sweave 
target, however, which is very nice.
