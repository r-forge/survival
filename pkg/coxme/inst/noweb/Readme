 Some portions of the coxme package have been written using the literate
programming paradym.  These are contained here, and have a .Rnw suffix.
Long term, it would be ideal to have all of the code source here to maximize
the documentation, and through it the reliability of the package.

These files are NOT intended for processing by Sweave.  The funcion of Sweave
is to execute R fragments, interspersing code and results.  The purpose of
this material is to create the .R source code and a detailed latex commentary
on that code.  In particular, Sweave does not echo code verbatim, it echos
the R parser's rewrite of the code.  This is necessary to correctly interleave
output but is counterproductive to our purposes since it removes useful
formatting.

The .Rnw suffix causes emacs work perfectly for either a noweb or Sweave 
target.
