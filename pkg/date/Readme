  The date library was created at about the same time and in parallel to
the chron library (without knowing about each other's efforts).  As one of
the first S efforts at a date class, it rates as a pretty good attempt,
but has been superseded in several aspects by both the Splus dateTime class
and the R date class.  Any new user should use those in preference.

  The routines for expected survival, survexp + any of the US rate tables,
had a dependence on the date routines, and so the survival functions became
the last bastion of their use.  This has been removed (2008), and they are
now stored as a separate library for those who may need them for backwards
compatability.

  Small soapbox: In one respect the date library is superior to Date.
As a simple example, let date1 and date2 by date objects, date3 and
date4 Date objects.  Then date1/date2 generates a number, date3/date4
an error message.  Now both packages store the dates interally as
numbers, the difference is in philosophy.  The Date library takes the
currently fashionable "object oriented" stance of the omniscient
designer: any actionn of the user that the designer did not forsee must be
an error.  The date library takes instead the "intellegent user"
stance: they might actually know what they are doing, and a design should be
helpful instead of condescending.  My preference is obvious.
