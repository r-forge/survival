  The date library was created at about the same time and in parallel to
the chron library (without knowing about each other's efforts).  As one of
the first S efforts at a date class it rates as a pretty good attempt,
but has been superseded in several aspects by both the Splus dateTime class
and the R Date class.  Any new user should use those in preference.

  The routines for expected survival, survexp + any of the US rate tables,
had a dependence on the date routines, and so the survival functions became
the last bastion of their use.  This has been removed (2008), and they are
now stored as a separate library for those who may need them for backwards
compatability.

  In moving the material to Rforge and then rearranging directories, I managed
to lose the cvs history of the package.  I decided it wasn't worth the hassle
of recreating.
