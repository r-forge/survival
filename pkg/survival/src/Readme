  There remains one .c file that has both Splus and R specific variants,
cox_callback.c.  All others have been unified, and this one will be also (I
expected to be done before now, actually).  The R CMD INSALL script is
unhappy if the Splus version is visible; so it is temporarily renamed with
a .csp suffix.
