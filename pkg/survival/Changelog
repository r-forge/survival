22 April 2009.  The coxph code had an override to iter and eps, making both of
them more strict for a penalized model.  However, the overall default values
have changed over time, so that these lines actually decreased accuracy - the
opposite of their intent.  Removed the lines.  Also removed the iter.miss and
eps.miss components (on which this check depended) from coxph.control, which
makes that function match its documentation.

1 May 2009. The anova.coxph function was incorrect for models with a strata
term.  Fixed this, and made chisquare tests the default.

20 May 2009.  The manual page for survfit was confusing, since it tries to 
document both the standard KM (formula method) and the coxph method.  I've
split them out so that now survfit documents only the basic method and points 
a user the appropriate specialized page.
