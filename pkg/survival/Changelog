22 April 2009.  The coxph code had an override to iter and eps, making both of
them more strict for a penalized model.  However, the overall default values
have changed over time, so that these lines actually decreased accuracy - the
opposite of their intent.  Removed the lines.  Also removed the iter.miss and
eps.miss components (on which this check depended) from coxph.control, which
makes that function match its documentation.

1 May 2009. The anova.coxph function was incorrect for models with a strata
term.  Fixed this, and made chisquare tests the default.

20 May 2009.  The manual page for survfit was confusing, since it tries to 
document both the standard KM (formula method) and the coxph method.  I've
split them out so that now survfit documents only the basic method and points 
a user the appropriate specialized page.

21 May 2009 Create a test case for factor variables/newdata/predict for coxph 
and survreg.  This led to a set of minor fixes; the code is now in line with
the R standard for model functions.  One consequence is that model.frame.coxph
and model.frame.survreg are no longer needed, so have been removed.

22 May 2009: Allow single subscripts to rate tables, e.g. survexp[1:10].  
Returns a simple vector of values.  The str() function does this to print out
a short summary.  Problem pointed out by Heinz Tuechler.
