Fixes since the survival 6 release

24Nov04: Change is.ratetable to give longer messages

8Dec04: Fix a small bug in survfit.turnbull.  See the long note in
testreg/Readme4.  If there are people left censored before the first
time point of any other kind (interval, exact, or right censored),
the the plotted height of the curve from "rightmost left censoring time"
to "leftmost event time", that is the flat tail on the left, was at
the wrong height.
  This has been incorporated into the Splus release --- after all, they
found it.  Added another test to testreg/reliability.s for this.

7Feb05: Modified print.ratetable to be more useful.  It now tells 
about the ratetable, rather than printing all of its values.

8Feb05: Add the data.frame argument to pyears.  This causes the output
to contain a dataframe rather than a set of arrays.  It is useful for
further processing of the data using Poisson regression.

8Feb05: Fix small typo in is.ratetable, introduced on 24Nov04.  (Today
was the first time I added to the standard library, and thus ended
up using the non-verbose mode.)

18Apr05: Bug in survfit.turnbull.  The strata variable was not being
filled in (number of points per curve).  So if multiple curves were
generated at once, i.e., with something on the right hand side of ~ in
the formula, all the downstream print/plot functions would not work
with the result.

5May05: Add the drop=F arg to one subscripting selection in survfit.coxph.
	        temp <- (matrix(surv$y, ncol=3))[ntime,,drop=F] 
If you selected only 1 time point (1 row) in the final output, the code
would fail.  Pointed out by Cindy Crowson.

27Sep05: Found and fixed a nasty bug in survfit.  When method='fh2' and
there were multiple groups I had a subscripting bug, leading to vectors
that were supposed to be the same length, but weren't, passed into C.
The resulting curves were obviously wrong -- survival precipitously drops 
to zero.

7Feb06: Fix a problem in the coxph iteration (coxfit2.c, coxfit5, agfit3,
agfit5, agexact).  It will likely never catch anyone again, even if I 
didn't fix it.  In a particular data set, beta overshot and step halving
was invoked.  During step halving, a loglik happened to occur that was
within eps of the prior step's loglik --- and the routine decided, erroneously,
that it had converged!  (A nice quadratic curve, a first guess x1 to the 
left of  the desired max of the curve.  The next guess x2 overshot and ends 
up with a lower loglik, on the right side of the max.  Back up to the 
midpoint of x1 and x2, and this guess, still to the right of the max (still
too large) has EXACTLY the same value of y as x1 did, but on the other side
of the max from x1.  "Last two guesses give the same answer, I'm done" said
the routine).

21Apr06: Fix problem in [.survfit, pointed out by Thomas Lumley.  If
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ ph.ecog, lung), then fit[2:1] did
not reorder the output correctly.  I had never tested putting the 
subscripts in non-increasing order.

26Apr06: Fix bug in summary.survfit, pointed out by Bob Treder.  With
the times option, the value of n.risk would be wrong for "in between"
times; e.g., the data had events and/or censoring at times 10,
20,... and we asked for printout at time 15.  It should give n.risk at time
20, it was returning the value at time 10. Interestingly, the code had
a very careful treatment of this case, along with an example in the
comments, and the "the right answer is" part of the comment was wrong!
So the code correctly computed an incorrect answer.  Added another
test case to the test suite, survtest2.

6Jun06: Sent the suite off to Insightful, so Bob gets the updates.

22Jun06: Update match.ratetable, so that more liberal matches are now
allowed.  For instance,  'F', 'f', 'female', 'fem', 'FEMA', etc are 
now all considered matches to the dimname "female" in survexp.us.

10May07: Change summary.coxph so that it returns an object of class
summary.coxph, and add a print method for that object.

9Jul07: In a model with offsets, survreg mistakenly omitted the offset
from the returned linear.predictor component.
