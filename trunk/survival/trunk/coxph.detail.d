.FN coxph.detail
.TL
Details of a cox model fit
.DN
Returns the individual contributions to the first and second derivative
matrix, at each unique event time.
.CS
coxph.detail(fit)
.RA
.AG fit
a cox model object, i.e., the result of `coxph'.
.RT
a list with components
.RC time
the vector of unique event times
.RC nevent
the number of events at each of these time points.
.RC means
a matrix with one row for each event time and one column for each variable
in the Cox model, containing the weighted mean of the variable at that time,
over all subjects still at risk at that time.  The weights are the risk
weights exp(x %*% fit$coef).
.RC nrisk
number of subjects at risk.
.RC hazard
the hazard increment.
.RC score
the contribution to the score vector (first derivative of the log
partial likelihood) at each time point.
.RC imat
the contribution to the information matrix (second derivative of the
log partial likelihood) at each time point.
.RC varhaz
the variance of the hazard increment.
.RC x, y, weights, strata
input data for the model
.DT
This function may be useful for those who wish to investigate new methods or
extensions to the Cox model.  The example below shows one way to calculate
the Shoenfeld residuals.
