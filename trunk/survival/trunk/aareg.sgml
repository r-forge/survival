Aalen's additive regression model for censored data
</s-title>
<s-description>
Returns an object of class <s-expression>"aareg"</s-expression> that
represents an Aalen model.

</s-usage>
<s-args-required>

<s-arg name=" formula ">
a formula object, with the response on the left of a `~' operator and 
the terms,
 separated by <s-expression>+</s-expression> operators, on the right. 
The response must be a <s-expression>Surv</s-expression> object.
Due to a particular computational approach that is used, the model
MUST include an intercept term.  If "-1" is used in the model
formula the program will ignore it.
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>

<s-arg name=" data ">
data frame in which to interpret the variables named in the
<s-expression>formula</s-expression>,
<s-expression>subset</s-expression>, and <s-expression>weights
</s-expression> arguments. This may also be a single number to handle
some speci al cases -- see below for details. If
<s-expression>data</s-expression> is missi ng, the variables in the
model formula should be in the search path.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name="weights">
vector of observation weights. If supplied, the fitting algorithm
minimizes the sum of the weights multiplied by the squared residuals
(see below for additional technical details). The length of
<s-expression>weights</s-expression> must be the same as the number of
observations. The weights must be nonnegative and it i s recommended
that they be strictly positive, since zero weights are ambiguous.  To
exclude particular observations from the model, use the
<s-expression>subset</s-expression> argument instead of zero weights.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name="subset">
expression specifying which subset of observations should be used in
the fit. Th is can be a logical vector (which is replicated to have
length equal to the numb er of observations), a numeric vector
indicating the observation numbers to be i ncluded, or a character
vector of the observation names that should be included.  All
observations are included by default.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name="na.action">
a function to filter missing data. This is applied to the
<s-expression>model.fr ame</s-expression> after any
<s-expression>subset</s-expression> argument has be en applied. The
default is <s-expression>na.fail</s-expression>, which returns a n
error if any missing values are found. An alternative is
<s-expression>na.excl ude</s-expression>, which deletes observations
that contain one or more missing values.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name=" qrtol ">
tolerance for detection of singularity in the QR decomposition
</s-arg>

<s-arg name=" nmin ">
minimum number of observations for an estimate; defaults to 3 times the
number of covariates.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name=" dfbeta ">
should the array of dfbeta residuals be computed.  This implies computation
of the sandwich variance estimate.
The residuals will always be computed if there is a
<s-expression>cluster</s-expression> term in the model formula.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name=" test ">
selects the weighting to be used, for computing an overall ``average''
coefficient vector over time and the subsequent test for equality to zero.
</s-arg>

<s-arg name=" model, x, y ">
should copies of the model frame, the x matrix of predictors, or the
response vector y be included in the saved result.
</s-arg>

</s-arg>
</s-args-optional>

<s-value>
an object of class <s-expression>"aareg"</s-expression> 
representing the fit.
</s-value>

<s-details>
The Aalen model assumes that the cumulative hazard H(t) for a subject
can be expressed as a(t) + X B(t), where a(t) is a time-dependent intercept
term, X is the vector of covariates for the subject (possibly time-dependent),
and B(t) is a time-dependent matrix of coefficients.
The estimates are inheritly non-parametric; a fit of the model will normally
be followed by one or more plots of the estimates.

The estimates may become unstable near the tail of a data set, since the
increment to B at time t is based on the subjects still at risk at time
t.  The tolerance and/or nmin parameters may act to truncate the estimate
before the last death.
