Parametric Survival Model Object 
</s-title>
<s-description>
Classes of objects that result from fitting a parametric survival model. 
</s-description>
<s-section name=" GENERATION">

This class of objects is returned by the <s-expression>survreg</s-expression> function 
to represent a fitted parametric survival model. 
Class <s-expression>survreg</s-expression> inherits from class <s-expression>glm</s-expression>, since it is fit by iterative 
reweighted least squares; the object returned has all the components of a 
weighted least squares object. 
</s-section>
<s-section name=" METHODS">

Objects of this class have methods for the functions <s-expression>print</s-expression>, 
<s-expression>summary</s-expression>, <s-expression>predict</s-expression>, and <s-expression>residuals</s-expression>. 
</s-section>
<s-section name=" STRUCTURE">

The following components must be included in a legitimate <s-expression>survreg</s-expression> object. 
The residuals, fitted values, coefficients and effects should be extracted 
by the generic functions of the same name, rather than 
by the <s-expression>"$"</s-expression> operator.  
</s-section>
<s-args>
<s-arg name="coefficients">
the coefficients of the <s-expression>linear.predictors</s-expression>, which multiply  the 
columns of the model matrix.  It does not include the estimate of error  
(sigma).  The names of the coefficients are the names of the 
single-degree-of-freedom effects (the columns of the model matrix). 
If the model is over-determined there will be missing values in the  
coefficients corresponding to nonestimable coefficients. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="family">
a 2 element character vector giving the name of the family and 
the link; mainly for printing purposes. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="parms">
the parameters of the model that are not coefficients of the model matrix. 
The first of these will always be <s-expression>log(sigma)</s-expression>. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="fixed">
a vector the same length as <s-expression>parms</s-expression>, where 1 indicates a parameter that 
was fixed at its starting value and was not part of the iteration. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="var">
the final variance matrix, including both coefficients and free parameters. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="dresiduals">
the deviance residuals. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="deviance">
minus twice the difference between the maximized log-likelihood under the 
fitted model and a saturated model. Similar to the residual sum of squares. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="null.deviance">
the deviance corresponding to the model with only an intercept term, and 
with <s-expression>parms</s-expression> fixed at their final values. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="loglik">
the log-likelihood for the final model. 
<br><br>
The object will also have the components of a <s-expression>glm</s-expression> object not mentioned 
above: <s-expression>linear predictors</s-expression>, <s-expression>fitted.values</s-expression>, <s-expression>residuals</s-expression>, <s-expression>effects</s-expression>, <s-expression>R</s-expression>,  
<s-expression>rank</s-expression>, <s-expression>assign</s-expression>, <s-expression>df.residual</s-expression>, <s-expression>weights</s-expression>, <s-expression>call</s-expression>, <s-expression>iter</s-expression>, <s-expression>contrasts</s-expression>,  
<s-expression>terms</s-expression> and <s-expression>formula</s-expression>.  See <s-expression>glm.object</s-expression>.
