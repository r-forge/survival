Survival Curve Object 
</s-title>
<s-description>
Class of objects that represent a fitted survival curve. 
</s-description>
<s-section name=" GENERATION">

This class of objects is returned by the <s-expression>survfit</s-expression> class of functions. 
</s-section>
<s-section name=" METHODS">

Objects of this class have methods for the functions <s-expression>print</s-expression>, 
<s-expression>summary</s-expression>, <s-expression>plot</s-expression>, <s-expression>points</s-expression> and <s-expression>lines</s-expression>. 
</s-section>
<s-section name=" STRUCTURE">

The following components must be included in a legitimate <s-expression>survfit</s-expression> 
object. 
</s-section>
<s-args>
<s-arg name="n">
total number of subjects. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="time">
the time points at which the curve has a step. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="n.risk">
the number of subjects at risk at t. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="n.event">
the number of events that occur at time t. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="enter">
if <s-expression>type</s-expression> argument is <s-expression>counting</s-expression>, the number of subjects that enter at time t. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="exit.censor">
if <s-expression>type</s-expression> argument is <s-expression>counting</s-expression>, the number of subjects that leave 
without an event  at time t. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="surv">
the estimate of survival at time t+0. 
This may be a vector or a matrix. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="strata.all">
if there are multiple curves, this component gives the total number of elements of 
the <s-expression>time</s-expression> etc. vectors before any subsetting, corresponding to the first curve, the second curve, 
and so on.  The names of the elements are labels for the curves. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="strata">
if there are multiple curves, this component gives the number of elements of 
the <s-expression>time</s-expression> etc. vectors corresponding to the first curve, the second curve, 
and so on.  The names of the elements are labels for the curves. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="ntimes.strata">
if there are multiple curves, this component gives the number of 
elements of 
the <s-expression>time</s-expression> etc. vectors for the first curve, the second curve, 
and so on. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="std.err">
the standard error of the cumulative hazard or -log(survival). 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="upper">
upper confidence limit for the survival curve. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="lower">
lower confidence limit for the survival curve. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="conf.type">
the approximation used to compute the confidence limits. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="conf.int">
the level of the confidence limits, e.g. 90 or 95%. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="na.action">
the returned value from the na.action function, if any.  It will be used 
in the printout of the curve, e.g., the number of observations deleted due 
to missing values. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="call">
an image of the call that produced the object. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="type">
type of survival censoring. 
</s-arg>
</s-args>
<s-section name=" SUBSCRIPTS">

Survfit objects that contain multiple survival curves can be subscripted. 
This is most often used to plot a subset of the curves. 
Usually a single subscript will be used.  In one particular case --- 
survival curves for multiple covariate values, from a Cox model that includes 
a <s-expression>strata</s-expression> statement --- there is a matrix of curves and 2 subscripts may 
be used. 
(In this case <s-expression>summary.survfit</s-expression> will also print the data as a matrix).
