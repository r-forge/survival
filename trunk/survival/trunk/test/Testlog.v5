 Comparisons with version 5 of Splus

1. A zillion format changes in the echoed printout.
    The "Compare" script tried to edit most of these out.  There is also
a change in iteration tolerance, which causes 1 more iter in lots of
Cox models, leading to minor coefficient changes.

2. predict(x, type='expected') may have no names when x is a coxph() object.
It shows up in the test suite at lines 214ff, where the new run has some
blank variable names.
The following code demonstrates that is is connected to na.omit:

	> m <- model.frame(Surv(futime,fustat)~ecog.ps, ovarian)
	> y <- model.extract(m, 'response')
	> dimnames(y)[[1]]
[1] "1"  "2"  "3"  "4"  "5"  "6"  "7"  "8"  "9"  "10" "11" "12" "13" "14" "15"
[16] "16" "17" "18" "19" "20" "21" "22" "23" "24" "25" "26"

	> options(na.action='na.omit')
	> ovarian2 <- ovarian
	> ovarian2$ecog.ps[21] <- NA
	> m <- model.frame(Surv(futime,fustat)~ecog.ps, ovarian2)
	> y <- model.extract(m, 'response')
	> dimnames(y)[[1]]
 [1] "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""

  This one has me baffled at the moment.  I can't see any substantive 
difference between the first and second model frames.


 3.The dotest1 and dotest2 files used a scratch variable "temp" to hold
the survival object.  This was hard to read (being nonstandard), and
caused confusion in the newdata argument for survfit.coxph (in S5).
Changed the code for clarity, which lets S5 off the hook.
  This shows up as a lot of "test$x" in the old file, "x" in the new, lines
250-290 approx.


4. Read.jasa.s attempted to create a data frame with a logical in it.  In both
Splus and v4 this isn't allowed- the as.data.frame.logical function turns
it into a factor!  We'll be weeding this idiocy out of the Mayo S version.
In Splus, by pure luck, the factor worked in the stan1 function (file kalb1.s),
I had the expression "jasa$transplant==1" when I meant "==T",
in S5 it didn't.  Changed the stan1 function to be logically correct, and
explicitly allow logicals in dataframes in the read.jasa.s function.


7. The following 5 lines killed version 5 release 1 dead
>  attach(jasa1)
>  ll <- length(start)
>  ss <- rep(0:1, c(ll,ll))
>  fit <- coxph(Surv(rep(start,2), rep(stop,2), rep(event,2)) ~
   			rep(age,2)*strata(ss) + I(rep(age,2)^2*ss) )

So I replaced them with

> tdata <- data.frame(start=rep(start,2), stop=rep(stop,2),
  		    event=rep(event,2), ss=ss, age=rep(age,2),
  		    age2 = (rep(age,2))^2 * ss)
> fit <- coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ age*strata(ss) + age2, tdata)

  Works now.  Something with data frames?


8. Lines 2230+ of output -- 
     The new survexp.us file goes back to 1940, the older one only to 1960.
The doexpect test has dummy subjects in the mid 1950's, so the results of
the test change.  Using 'survexp.us[,,3:6]' as the ratetable gives the old
results.

 9. Added "rm" statements to the end of several test files, to forestall
any confusion of temporary variables between one test and another.

10. The survexp.cfit function with individual=T is killed by a bug in approx.
Try "approx(1:4,1:4, 1:4, f=1)" or any other approx call with the "f" arg.
  Line 2205 of testall.out.  

  Update: Ok in release 2 of S5.

11. Changed "digits" in the survreg printout, but no real changes in the
answers.  Because of the recent change (bugfix) in computation of intial
values, 2 of the tests change their number of iterations to convergence.

  The addition of penalized surveg models was a chance to do away with
deviance based printout entirely, so layout changed a lot.

--------------------------------
 Comparison of testall.save and testall.v4 on 2/8/98

Ignoring all of the formating changes, and small differences due to 
convergence criteria...

1. "10.2" vs "17.2" in an infinite beta case, line 155.

2. Survival curve after a stratified Cox model, line 379ff.  The old
code had too small a variance for the second curve.  I think this is a
side effect of the 5/2/97 fix.
   Similar effect at line 1439.

3. Changed survival, line 1787.  Related to the fix of 9/25/98.

4. Survexp/rate table change noted above.

5. The changed format in the survreg results makes "diff" very hard.  I
think that the new results are good, but could have missed something in the
comparison.  The better initial estimates make the iteration path different
as well, so all results differ in the last digits.
