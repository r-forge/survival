<s-args-required>
<s-arg name=" x ">
the result of a call to the <s-object>aareg</s-object> function
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>

<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name=" maxtime ">
the upper time point to be used in the test for non-zero slope
</s-arg>

<s-arg name=" weight ">
the weighting to be used in the test for non-zero slope.
The default weights are based on the variance of each coefficient, as
a function of time.  The alternative weight is proportional to the number
of subjects still at risk at each time point.
</s-arg>
</s-args-optional>

<s-value>
the calling argument is returned.
</s-value>

<s-side-effects>
the results of the fit are displayed.
</s-side-effects>

<s-details>
The estimated increments in the coefficient estimates can become quite
unstable near the end of follow-up, due to the small number of observations
still at risk in a data set.
Thus, the test for slope will sometimes be more powerful if this last
`tail' is excluded.
