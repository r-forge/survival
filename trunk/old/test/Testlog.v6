7/2001 -- Changes to the test suite and log for S version 6

1. The labels that disappeared (note 2 of Testlog.v5) have come back!

2. Three files had a line
		options(contrasts='contr.treatment')
which was technically wrong (should have a second option listed for ordered
factors) but worked ok since I had no ordered factors.  S6 flags this line
as an error.  Since they were redundant with setup.s anyway, I removed them.


3. n=2 vs n=10?

4. Added more tests, and turned some from printouts to "all.equal" type.
